# Ideas for December 11, 2025

## Research

### What's culturally electric right now?
- **Anti-AI backlash is MASSIVE** - TIME's "Architects of AI" Person of the Year cover sparked a cultural firestorm (posts with 100k+ likes calling AI "cancer", "zombie apocalypse")
- People are fiercely defending human creativity and authenticity
- Sleep deprivation/exhaustion memes are viral ("1:30am vs 6am" energy)
- Year-end reflection content is peaking
- The tension between human vs AI creativity is THE cultural conversation

### What are people wishing existed?
- Ways to prove/celebrate human-made content
- Tools that champion human creativity over AI
- Something that lets them feel part of the "human resistance"

### New tech that enables something new
- AI detection APIs have gotten quite good
- The cultural moment makes anti-AI tools timely
- Simple browser-based games/experiences can go viral

### Underserved communities
- Artists feeling threatened by AI
- People who want to celebrate human imperfection
- Anyone exhausted by AI-generated slop

## Candidates

### 1. Human Art Defender
- **The hook**: "Prove your art is 100% human. Get your badge."
- **Why it's interesting**: Taps into the massive anti-AI wave
- **Novel because**: Instead of detecting AI, it CELEBRATES humanity
- **Durability**: AI anxiety will persist for years
- **Shareability**: HIGH - shareable badges, gallery of human art
- **Tech angle**: AI detection API + badge generation
- **Buildability**: Medium (needs AI detection API)
- **Requires API keys**: Yes (detection APIs)

### 2. The Turing Gallery
- **The hook**: "Can you tell which art is human? Prove it."
- **Why it's interesting**: Interactive game that makes you appreciate human creativity
- **Novel because**: Flips the script - instead of AI judging us, WE judge AI
- **Durability**: The human vs AI distinction will be relevant for years
- **Shareability**: HIGH - competitive scores, shareable results
- **Tech angle**: Curated comparison of human vs AI art, scoring system
- **Buildability**: Easy (no API needed - curated content)
- **Requires API keys**: No

### 3. Sleep Debt Calculator
- **The hook**: "How many hours of sleep do you owe yourself?"
- **Why it's interesting**: Taps into exhaustion meme culture
- **Novel because**: Quantifies the universal experience of tiredness
- **Durability**: Medium - sleep is always relevant but not novel
- **Shareability**: Medium
- **Tech angle**: Fun calculations, data viz
- **Buildability**: Easy
- **Requires API keys**: No

### 4. Year of Feelings
- **The hook**: "What did 2025 feel like? Map your emotional year."
- **Why it's interesting**: Year-end reflection with a twist
- **Novel because**: Interactive emotion timeline, not just highlights
- **Durability**: Low - very seasonal
- **Shareability**: High
- **Tech angle**: Timeline visualization, emotion mapping
- **Buildability**: Easy
- **Requires API keys**: No

### 5. The Human Test
- **The hook**: "Play games that prove you're gloriously, imperfectly human."
- **Why it's interesting**: Interactive challenges that celebrate human quirks
- **Novel because**: A battery of challenges that AI would ace but humans mess up beautifully
- **Durability**: HIGH - the human vs AI theme has staying power
- **Shareability**: VERY HIGH - scores, badges, compare with friends
- **Tech angle**: Browser games, randomization, scoring, shareable results
- **Buildability**: Easy-Medium (no APIs, just fun games)
- **Requires API keys**: No

## Decision

**Building**: The Human Test

**Why this one**:
1. **No API keys needed** - can ship immediately
2. **Taps into the anti-AI cultural moment** without being preachy
3. **Celebrates human imperfection** - the opposite of AI perfection
4. **Highly shareable** - competitive scores, badges, social sharing
5. **Actually fun** - not just commentary, but an experience
6. **Durable** - will still be interesting in months

**The vision**:
A series of mini-challenges that celebrate what makes humans beautifully imperfect:
- Draw a perfect circle (and watch it wobble)
- Type a sentence without any typos... wait, that was a typo
- Click exactly 10 times (you'll overshoot)
- Remember a sequence (and forget it)
- Draw from memory
- React at the exact right moment (too early! too late!)

At the end: A "Humanity Score" with sharable results like:
"You're 94% human. Your circle was beautifully wonky. You made 3 typos. Your timing was charmingly off."

**Tagline**: "In a world of perfect AI, celebrate your beautiful imperfections."
